Overview
The Smart Student Management System is a console-based application designed to manage student records.

The application uses MySQL for persistent storage and follows a layered architecture with DAO (Data Access Object) and service layers.

CRUD Operations:
Add new students with validation for unique roll numbers and marks range (0-100).
View all students or retrieve specific students by ID or roll number.
Update existing student records.
Delete students with confirmation.


Search Functionality:
Search students by name (partial match), department, or marks range.


Statistics:
Display total number of students.
Show highest and lowest marks.
Provide department-wise student count.


User Interface: Interactive console-based UI with clear menus and input validation.
